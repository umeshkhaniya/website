# Project

### [Project 1: Microstate Analysis of Protein](https://github.com/umeshkhaniya/microstate_lysozyme_analysis)

This project invloves the novel way of finding the right protonated state for Molecular Dynamics Simulation. In this project, millions of microstates obtained during the Monte Carlo run are used for analysis. This is now used in  Marilyn Gunner Lab to find the protonation state and  also has free energy, PDb writing functionality. 
* **Python libraries used:** Python3
* **Input:** Microstate file from MCCE output
* **Output:** Protonation state of Protein 

### [Project 2: Drug Discovery using the Machine Learning approach](https://github.com/umeshkhaniya/Drug-Discovery-using-the-Machine-Learning-approach)

This project  is inspired from Data Professor. Here  I used different machine learining techniques to predcit the IC50 value of Aromatase Inhibitor.
* **Libraries used:** Streamlit, Sklearn, python3
